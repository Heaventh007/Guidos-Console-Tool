# Guidos-Console-Tool
Pasted tool "created" by Guido. 

Alllright, Guido decided to pasted from both me, and Cicada. He's selling this tool WITHOUT CREDITS, for $15. 

Here's a fully compilable (if that's the word), version of his tool. Free for everyone, because people shouldn't 
have to pay for something that's already free right? 

You'll need DevExpress.v22.2. I won't be distrubting any cracks, however you can find the DLL's you need in the release
of the tool itself. 

Any other references should all be in the releases, and the source. 

Enjoy everyone!
